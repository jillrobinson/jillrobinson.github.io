The standard error of the mean, is the standard deviation of the [sampling distribution of the mean](/flashcards/2020/05/11/central-limit-theorem/):

$$\sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{N}} \approx \frac{s}{\sqrt{N}}$$

where:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$$N$$ is the number of samples

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$$\sigma$$ is the population standard deviation

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$$s$$ is the sample standard deviation
