With sufficiently large sample size, $$n$$, the sampling distribution of sample means approximates a normal distribution, regardless of the population distribution type.

Assuming:
- The population distribution has a well defined mean and standard deviation
- The samples are:
    - independent
    - randomly sampled. If sampled without replacement, $$n$$ must make up less than 10% of population
    - of sufficient size, $$n \geq 30$$ is generally recommended. If population distribution is normal, $$n$$ can be of any size

As $$n$$ increases, the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sampling mean decreases. This standard deviation is also known as [standard error of the mean](/flashcards/2020/05/11/standard-error-of-the-mean/).
