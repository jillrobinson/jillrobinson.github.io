Hi, I’m Jill. I’m a data scientist living in Australia.

I lived in the US for 5 years, using data to help people find their dream home. Now I work at [Canva](canva.com), a graphic design company, where I lead a kickass team of data analysts to help ordinary people design anything they want, from business cards to Instagram posts.

I love learning new things, travelling to new places and (ironically) watching my favourite movies over and over again. I also have an adorable dog with a pathological obsession for socks.
